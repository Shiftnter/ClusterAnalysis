Observations and Suggestions:
Clustering on Wholesale Customers Dataset:

The clustering algorithms (KMeans, Birch, DBSCAN) and metrics evaluation are well-implemented.
The dunn_index and purity_score functions are thoughtful additions for custom evaluation.
Issue: purity_score uses true_labels but the clustering methods generate their own labels, causing potential misalignment when comparing metrics across methods.
Consider passing real ground truth if available or clarify the evaluation without true labels.
Visualization:

PCA is applied for dimensionality reduction before visualization, which is a good approach.
In plot_clustering, ensure the color mapping aligns with unique clusters.
For DBSCAN, some labels might be -1 (noise), so handle them appropriately in the plot.
Yale Dataset Processing:

Images are resized to 100x100 and flattened for clustering. Ensure this doesn't lose critical features.
Ensure images are uniformly preprocessed before applying clustering (e.g., consistent lighting, centering faces).
DBSCAN Parameter Selection:
The k-distance graph is excellent for determining eps. Refine eps based on the graph before running DBSCAN.
Metrics for Yale Dataset:

Evaluate clustering results using metrics like:
Silhouette Score: Valid if more than one cluster is found.
Davies-Bouldin Index: Lower is better.
Calinski-Harabasz Score: Higher is better.
Use ground truth (if available) for metrics like Adjusted Rand Index.
Improvements to Consider:

Use try-except blocks to handle exceptions during clustering, especially with DBSCAN (sensitive to eps and min_samples).
For visualization, display the cluster centers overlaid on the data when using KMeans.
Validate and compare the clustering performance by testing with varying numbers of clusters for KMeans and Birch.
